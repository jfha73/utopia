The True Free World

Utopia is a 3D world where everything is free, is a world where there is no money, where characters do what they do not for payment but to grow, to make themselves useful.

I like to think of it as a combination of Oasis from Ready Player One and Life Itself from Free Guy.

Since this project is 100% free it also means that nobody gets paid from working on it, we work on Utopia for the same reasons characters do it in their world, to make the world a better place.

So join us and help make this world (the earth) a better place too.

We prefer to use languages like Python ot Go and avoid using languages like Java

Utopia is a Free and Open Source Project, we won't change for anyhing, if you use any part of it in your own project(s) it must be free too
