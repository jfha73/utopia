The True Free World

Utopia is a 3D world where everything is free, is a world where there is no money, where characters do what they do not for payment but to grow, to make themselves useful.

I like to think of it as a combination of Oasis from Ready Player One and Life Itself from Free Guy.

Since this project is 100% free it also means that nobody gets paid from working on it, we work on Utopia for the same reasons characters do it in their world, to make the world a better place.

So join us and help make this world (the earth) a better place too.

We prefer to use languages like Python or Go and avoid using languages like Java

I am starting this hoping there are other sould out there that are like me who think that money is the cause of all the problems in the world and who would like to know what would happen in a world without money.

I would like to hear those words from Free Guy: "There is no Bank"
